<h1>D280 Interactive World Map</h1>


This project was generated with Angular CLI version 16.0.2.

Development server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. I also removed the node_modules directory because it is large and unnecessary for GitHub. So, you will need to run npm install to reinstall Node.JS for the application to run.
